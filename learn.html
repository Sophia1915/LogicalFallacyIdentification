        <div class="fallacy">
            <h2>Ad Hominem</h2>
            <p>The ad hominem fallacy is committed when one attacks a person's character or personal traits instead of addressing their argument or position.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="fallacy">
            <h2>Anecdotal Evidence</h2>
            <p>The anecdotal evidence fallacy occurs when one uses a personal experience or isolated example as evidence, rather than relying on broad, empirical data.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="fallacy">
            <h2>Appeal to Authority</h2>
            <p>The appeal to authority fallacy is committed when one claims something is true simply because an expert or authority on the subject believes it, without addressing the actual evidence or reasoning.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="fallacy">
            <h2>Appeal to Emotion</h2>
            <p>The appeal to emotion fallacy happens when one attempts to persuade not through logical argument, but by eliciting strong emotional responses.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="fallacy">
            <h2>Appeal to Ignorance</h2>
            <p>The appeal to ignorance fallacy occurs when one argues that something must be true because it hasn't been proven false (or vice versa).</p>
        </div>

        <div class="fallacy">
            <h2>Appeal to Popularity</h2>
            <p>The appeal to popularity fallacy is committed when one argues that something is true or good simply because many people believe or do it.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="fallacy">
            <h2>Begging the Question</h2>
            <p>The begging the question fallacy happens when an argument's premises assume the truth of the conclusion, resulting in a circular argument.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="fallacy">
            <h2>False Cause</h2>
            <p>The false cause fallacy occurs when one mistakenly asserts that because two events occur together, one must have caused the other.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="fallacy">
            <h2>Personal Incredulity</h2>
            <p>The personal incredulity fallacy is committed when one finds something hard to believe and therefore concludes it's untrue.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="fallacy">
            <h2>Tu Quoque</h2>
            <p>The tu quoque fallacy, also known as the "you too" fallacy, happens when one responds to criticism by accusing the critic of the same issue or behavior.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="fallacy">
            <h2>Slippery Slope</h2>
            <p>The slippery slope fallacy occurs when one argues that a specific action will trigger a series of negative events without providing evidence for that chain of events.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="fallacy">
            <h2>Straw Man</h2>
            <p>The straw man fallacy is committed when one misrepresents an opponent's argument to make it easier to attack or refute, instead of addressing the actual argument presented.</p>
